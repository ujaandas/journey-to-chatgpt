# Journey to ChatGPT

This repository contains native C implementations of all major types of machine
learning, and aims to provide a structured approach towards gaining a
foundational and mathematical understanding of ML. The idea is that eventually,
we will build upon our previous models/techniques to build a mini ChatGPT, all
in C.
